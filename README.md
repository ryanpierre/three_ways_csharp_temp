# C# Three Ways

<!-- OMITTED -->

This module is designed for people who want to learn the C# programming language. By following it, you will:

* Learn to use C#'s basic syntax.
* Learn to test-drive simple procedural programming problems using C#.
* Learn to test-drive programs in C# using Object Oriented Programming.
* Learn to test-drive database-backed web applications using {{FRAMEWORK}}, a common web framework for C#.

<!-- OMITTED -->

You will do this through three projects:

1. **Fizzbuzz**
   You will use C# to test-drive a Fizzbuzz program. In this you will learn the rudiments of the language, including how to run code, how to test code, how to use branching and looping logic, and how to call and return values.

2. **Bank**
   You will use C# to test-drive a bank application using Object Oriented Programming. You will learn how to test-drive an application using objects and methods that interact with each other, how to isolate your tests, and how to manage state.

3. **Twitter [NOT LIKE THIS]**
   You will use C# and {{FRAMEWORK}} to test-drive a database-backed web application much like Twitter. You will learn how to build in this framework, how to test drive it, and handle a more realistic degree of debugging and complexity.
